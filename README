# Python Access to Apple's Calendar App

To run this code, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the appscript module by running the command `pip install appscript` in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Modify the `add_to_calendar` function to specify the calendar you want to add the event to.
4. Call the `add_to_calendar` function with the event details you want to add to the calendar.
5. Run the Python file by running the command `python3 trip.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

Note that this code is specific to Apple's Calendar app and will only work on macOS. Additionally, you will need to have the Calendar app open for the events to be added to the calendar.
