# Python Access to Apple's Calendar App

This project allows users to interact with Apple's Calendar app using Python.

## Installation

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the appscript module by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```zsh
pip install appscript
```

## Usage

1. Modify the `add_to_calendar` file and update the data surrounded by `<>` with your desired event details.

2. Run the Python file by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```zsh
python3 apple-calendar.py
```

Note: Make sure to have the Calendar app open while running the script for the events to be added to the calendar. The first time you run the script you will prompted to allow access to the Calendar app. You will need to allow access for the script to work.

- [ ] Delete the events that were created with this script.
- [ ] Add alarm functionality to the events.
- [ ] Implement color coding for different types of events.
